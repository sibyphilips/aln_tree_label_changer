# aln_tree_label_changer
In any case (like when you use PAML) you need to change the names of the sequences or tree tips to other ones which better suits your needs, then this script can be used/modified.

Use: 

>**python3 /dir/where/the/script/is/stored/name_changer.py**

to call the program, from a linux terminal.

Give as inputs the absolute path to the file to be changed, and also the csv file (with commas separating the columns). The script will replace the long/old names with short/new names.

This could be especially useful when we need to change the names of tips in a tree before rendering it for publication.
